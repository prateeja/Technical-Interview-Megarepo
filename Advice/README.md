# Interview Advice

## What is the interviewer looking for?
This is something you can ask about before the interview. Here are some of the things I look for when interviewing software engineer candidates:
### Correctness.
  * Is the code correct? Does it cover all the edge/corner cases?
  * I am NOT looking for code that will compile perfectly. That said, the more flawless your code is, the more it looks like you know what you're doing.
### Readability.
  * Are the variable names descriptive?
  * Is the code easy to read or confusing?
  * Does the candidate comment their code?
### Scalability.
* How efficient is the solution? Will it scale?
* How does the solution balance memory and CPU usage?
* Can the candidate describe how they would adapt their solution to different memory and CPU constraints?
* If needed, can the candidate make the requested optimizations to their solution?
### Architecture/Design.
* How does the candidate model their solution to the given problem? Is the design clear, sound, and appropriate to the application?
* Separation of concerns. Is the logic and data appropriately encapsulated?
### Personability.
* What is the candidate's personality like? Do they seem like they would work well in a team?
* Is the candidate open to criticism and requests for changes?
* Is the candidate kind? Easygoing? Arrogant?
### Domain Knowledge.
* How well does the candidate know their language of choice? Are they able to apply it adeptly?
* I am NOT looking for knowledge of language triva (some interviewers do ask these kinds of questions).

## In General:
1. Ask questions
  * The interviewer may not give you enough information. Be sure to ask clarifying questions.
2. Think out loud
  * The interviewer can't read your mind. Say your thoughts aloud so your thought process can be heard.
3. Give reasons for the choices you make
4. Describe how you are going to try to solve the problem
5. Practice writing code on a whiteboard! Muscle memory is very important and practicing this will give you one less thing to worry about.
6. Practice problems that have lots of subtle edge cases. Think about how your code will run with different types of input.
7. Know trivia about your language of choice
  1. The interviewer may ask you questions like "What sorting algorithm is used in the list data structure's .sort() method?"
