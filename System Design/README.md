## Design Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Software Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
* "In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations."
* [Design patterns for humans](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans)

### Creational Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Creational Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
* "In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation."
* [Abstract Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) - "Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes."

### Structural Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Structural Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)
* "In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities."
* [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) - "Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator."

### Behavioral Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Behavioral Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)
* "In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication."
* [Iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) - "Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation."

### Concurrency Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Concurrency Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_pattern)
* "In software engineering, concurrency patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm."
* [Active Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object) - "Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests."
